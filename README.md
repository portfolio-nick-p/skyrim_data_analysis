# skyrim_data_analysis
A repository containing my basic analysis of a number of datasets on Bethesda's 2010 game Skyrim. Datasets include tables on characters, books, weapons and ingredients. This is small project meant to showcase my ability to load and clean data with Python and SQLite3, and my ability to write complex SQL queries that can be visualized with Pandas.
